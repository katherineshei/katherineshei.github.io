#Hey There!
I've learned so much in my SDS348 course this year and wanted to share some of the things we worked on.

##R and Python Can Talk to Each Other...
You can use reticulate to use Python within an R session and to share information across code chunks. Don't believe me? Check this out!


This is an R code chunk. We're using an R code chunk, in an R session... nothing special to see here yet.
```{R}
library(reticulate)

FromR <- "I came from R!"
```

Now, here's a Python chunk in an R session. The magic is about to begin!
```{python}
print(r.FromR)

FromPython = "I came from Python!"
```
As you can see, we've grabbed "FromR" from our R code chunk using a Python code chunk. 

But wait, there's more! We can also grab "FromPython" from our Python code chunk using our R code chunk:
```{R}
py$FromPython 
```
This is how R and Python talk to each other and how you can use Python interactively within an R session.


##How About an Example?
Christmas is coming, and it's time to start your gift shopping. You want to go big this year and surprise your best friend with some *(drum roll please)* diamond jewelry! You're not quite sure what type of diamond to get them, so you want to look into price ranges for different types. This is a huge expense, and you want to save as much money as you can while still earning the title of 'Best Gift Giver and Best Friend'.

Let's take a look at some information about diamonds:
```{python}
import seaborn as sns

sparkle=sns.load_dataset('diamonds')

sparkle.head()
```

You want to visualize the price of the diamonds depending on their carat and depth to help you decide.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

sparkle<-py$sparkle
qplot(sparkle$price, sparkle$carat) 

qplot(sparkle$price, sparkle$depth)
```
After looking through the data, you see that every price range of diamonds have a similar range of depths. You see that with an increase in price comes an increase in the carats, so you decide to go with something in the middle: a diamond with two carats. Your search is done, and you can now claim the title of Best Gift Giver and Best Friend. You're welcome!
